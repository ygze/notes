CSS Tutorial

## Selector
   * The element Selector:  The element selector selects elements based on the element name.
   * The id Selector:   The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
   * The class Selector: The class selector selects elements with a specific class attribute. To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the name of the class.

   You can also specify that only specific HTML elements should be affected by a class.
   ```javascript
      p.center {
                text-align: center;
                color: red;
              }
   ```

   HTML elements can also refer to more than one class.
   ```javascript
     <p class="center large">This paragraph refers to two classes.</p>
   ```
## CSS Comments
   A CSS comment starts with /* and ends with */. Comments can also span multiple lines.
